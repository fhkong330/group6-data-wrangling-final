# Education Level and Employment Status

This R project explores the relationship between education level and employment status across U.S. states from 2016 to 2020. We use data from the **National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)** and the **monthly unemployment data retrieved via the FRED API** to conduct data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling.
